# Introduction-to-Quantum-Computing-Quantum-Algorithms-and-Qiskit
My assignments for the Introduction to Quantum Computing: Quantum Algorithms and Qiskit on nptel (https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc21_cs103/course).
These files are fully solved and many doubts were clarified by the learners and mentors in the course's discord server.
Note - The notebooks require qiskit to be installed in your local machine, or you can run them on the IBM cloud (quantum-computing.ibm.com).
